# One-click archive.today

This is a fork of [One-click Wayback](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/one-click-wayback/), changed to go to archive.today instead of the Wayback Machine.

One-click archive.today is a Web Extension that displays a toolbar button that searches [archive.today](https://archive.today) for your current page.

This is useful if the page you're browsing no longer exists, and you want to quickly check whether archive.today has a copy.

## Installation

TO BE UPDATED

## Features

* Button.
* It's [5 lines of code](background.js).
* **No special permissions.**

## Alternatives

* [Archive Page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/archive-page/): Also for archive.today, but One-click archive.today will **search** for the page, while Archive Page will **save** the page to archive when the toolbar icon is clicked (you can still search for the page via the context menu though).
* [Extension "Web Archives"](https://github.com/dessant/web-archives): Search many different archive engines. More features, more UI, more permissions.
